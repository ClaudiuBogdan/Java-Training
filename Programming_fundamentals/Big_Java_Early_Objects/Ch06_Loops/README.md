# Key ideas:
##### Explain the flow of execution in a loop.
* A loop executes instructions repeatedly while a
  condition is true.
* An off­by­one error is a common error when
  programming loops. Think through simple test
  cases to avoid this type of error.
##### Use for loops for implementing count-controlled loops.
* The for loop is used when a value runs from a starting point to an ending point
  with a constant increment or decrement.
##### Choose between the while loop and the do loop.
* The **do loop** is appropriate when the loop body must be executed at least once.
##### Implement loops that read sequences of input data.
* A sentinel value denotes the end of a data set, but it is not part of
  the data.
* You can use a Boolean variable to control a loop. Set the
  variable to true before entering the loop, then set it to false to
  leave the loop.
* Use input redirection to read input from a file. Use output
  redirection to capture program output in a file.
##### Use the technique of storyboarding for planning user interactions.
* A storyboard consists of annotated sketches for each step in an action sequence.1
* Developing a storyboard helps you understand the inputs and outputs that are1
  required for a program.1
##### Use a debugger to analyze your programs.
* A debugger is a program that you can use to execute another program
  and analyze its run­time behavior.
* You can make effective use of a debugger by mastering just three concepts:
  breakpoints, single­stepping, and inspecting variables.
* When a debugger executes a program, the execution is suspended whenever a
  breakpoint is reached.
* The single­step command executes the program one line at a time.
* Use the divide­and­conquer technique to locate the point of failure of a program.
* During debugging, compare the actual contents of variables against the values
  you know they should have.
