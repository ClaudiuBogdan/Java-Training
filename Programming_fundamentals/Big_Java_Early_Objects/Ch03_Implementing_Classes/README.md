# Key ideas:

* An **objectâ€™s instance variables** *store the data* required for *executing its methods*.
* **Each object** of a class has its *own set of instance variables*.
* **Private instance variables** can *only* be accessed by *methods of the same class*.
* <u>**Encapsulation is the process of hiding implementation details and providing methods for data access**</u>.
* **Encapsulation** <u>allows</u> a programmer to *<u>use</u> a class without having to know its implementation*.
* **Information hiding** makes it simpler for the implementor of a class to locate errors and change implementations.
* **Constructors** set the initial data for objects.
* <u>The constructor name is always the same as the class name</u>.
* Use **documentation comments** to describe the classes and public methods of your programs.
* Provide documentation comments for every class, every method, every parameter variable, and every return value.
* The **private implementation** of a class consists of instance variables, and the bodies of constructors and methods.
* **A unit test verifies that a class works correctly in isolation, outside a complete program**.
* **Local variables** are declared in the body of a method.
* When a method exits, its local variables are removed.
* Instance variables are initialized to a default value, but you must initialize local variables.
* A local variable shadows an instance variable with the same name. You can access the instance variable name through the this reference.
* A method call without an implicit parameter is applied to the same object.
