## Project 3.13 (page127)

In this project, you will explore an object-oriented alternative to the “Hello, World”
program in Chapter 1. 
Begin with a simple Greeter class that has a single method, sayHello. 
That method should return a string, not print it. 
Create two objects of this class and invoke their sayHello methods.Of course, both objects return the same answer.
 Enhance the Greeter class so that each object produces a customized greeting. For example, the object constructed as new Greeter("Dave") should say "Hello, Dave". (Use the concat method to combine strings to form a longer string, or peek ahead at Section 4.5 to see how you can use the + operator for the same purpose.) 
 Add a method sayGoodbye to the Greeter class. 
 Finally, add a method refuseHelp to the Greeter class. It should return a string such as "I am sorry, Dave. I am afraid I can’t do that." If you use BlueJ, place two Greeter objects on the workbench (one that greets the world and one that greets Dave) and invoke methods on them. Otherwise, write a tester program that constructs these objects, invokes methods, and prints the results.
