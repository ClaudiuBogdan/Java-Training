# Project 4.1 (page170)
Write a program that helps a person decide whether to buy a hybrid car. Your program’s inputs should be: <br>
* The cost of a new car
* The estimated miles driven per year
* The estimated gas price
* The efficiency in miles per gallon
* The estimated resale value after 5 years
<br>
Compute the total cost of owning the car for five years. (For simplicity, we will not
take the cost of financing into account.) Obtain realistic prices for a new and used
hybrid and a comparable car from the Web. Run your program twice, using today’s
gas price and 15,000 miles per year. Include pseudocode and the program runs with
your assignment.
