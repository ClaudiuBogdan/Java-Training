# Project 4.3 (page171)

In this project, you will perform calculations with triangles. A triangle is defined by
the x- and y-coordinates of its three corner points. <br>
Your job is to compute the following properties of a given triangle:
* the lengths of all sides
* the angles at all corners
* the perimeter
* the area 
<br>

Implement a Triangle class with appropriate methods. Supply a program that
prompts a user for the corner point coordinates and produces a nicely formatted
table of the triangle properties.
