## Key ideas:

* **Java** has **eight primitive types**, including **four integer** types and **two ï¬‚oating-point** types.
* A **numeric computation overflows** if the result falls outside the range for the number type.
* **Rounding errors** occur when an exact conversion between numbers is not possible.
* A **final variable** is a **constant**. Once its value has been set, it cannot be changed.
* <u>If both arguments of / are integers, the remainder is discarded</u>.
* The **%** operator computes the **remainder of an integer division**.
* Use the **Scanner** class to **read keyboard input** in a console window.
* Use the **printf** method to specify **how values should be formatted**.
