# Key ideas:
* **Objects** are entities in your program that you *manipulate by
      calling methods*.
* A **method** is a sequence of instructions that *accesses the data
  of an object*.
* A **class** describes a *set of objects with the same behavior*.
* The **public interface** of a class specifies what you *can do
  with its objects*. The **hidden implementation** describes
  how these *actions are carried out*.
* An **object reference** describes the *location of an object in memory*.
