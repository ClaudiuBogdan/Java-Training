# Key ideas:
##### Recognize how to discover classes and their responsibilities.
* To discover classes, look for nouns in the problem description.
* Concepts from the problem domain are good candidates for classes.
* A CRC card ( “classes”, “responsibilities”, “collaborators”) describes a class, its responsibilities, and its collaborating classes.

##### Categorize class relationships and produce UML diagrams that describe them.
* Categorize class relationships and produce UML diagrams that describe them.
* It is a good practice to minimize the coupling (i.e., dependency) between classes.
* A class aggregates another if its objects contain objects of the other class.
* Inheritance (the is-a relationship) is sometimes inappropriately used when the
  has-a relationship would be more appropriate.
* Aggregation (the has-a relationship) denotes that objects of one class contain
  references to objects of another class.
* You need to be able to distinguish the UML notation for inheritance, interface
  implementation, aggregation, and dependency.

##### Apply an object-oriented development process to designing a program.
* Start the development process by gathering and documenting program
  requirements.
* Use CRC cards to find classes, responsibilities, and collaborators.
* Use UML diagrams to record class relationships.
* Use javadoc comments (with the method bodies left blank) to record the
  behavior of classes.
* After completing the design, implement your classes.
