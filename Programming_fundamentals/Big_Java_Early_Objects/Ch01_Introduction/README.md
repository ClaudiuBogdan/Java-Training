# Key ideas:
  * **Programming** is the act of designing and implementing computer programs.
  * **Classes** are the fundamental building blocks of Java programs (object-oriented).
  *  Every **Java application** contains a class with a main method. When the application
starts, the instructions in the main method are executed
  * A **compile-time error** is a violation of the programming language rules that is
detected by the compiler.
  *  A **run-time error** causes a program to take an action that the programmer did
not intend.
  * An **algorithm** for solving a problem is a sequence of steps that
is unambiguous, executable, and terminating.
  * **Pseudocode** is an informal description of a sequence of steps
for solving a problem.
